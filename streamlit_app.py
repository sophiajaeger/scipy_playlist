# **Analyzing music behaviour and predicting playlists**

Ideen:


*   three songs -> new ideas
*   load, preprocess data

*   streamlit app as input formular for extra criteria


  *   visualization and analysation
      *   features over the years (bmp, dancability, energy, valence, ...)
      *   bpm, dancability and valence (3D)
      * average length over the years (statistical analysis)
      *   bpm, dancability, liveness
      * distribution of key features (e.g., energy, danceability, acousticness) across different languages

* ML
  * clustering into genres (k means oder hierarchical clustering)
    * clustering using multiple audio features (using K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering) to identify different "types" of tracks that might not necessarily align with traditional genres
  * song prediction to 3 given songs (k nearest neighbors?)

Requirements to have installed:
 * kaggle
 * numpy  ?preinstalled
 * pandas ?preinstalled
